Bing Maps TypeScript Declarations
=================================

### Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Kyle-Muir/bing-maps-ajax-control-typescript-declaration.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Kyle-Muir/bing-maps-ajax-control-typescript-declaration) [![Nuget Package](http://img.shields.io/badge/nuget-v1.0.5-blue.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BingMapsTypeScript/1.0.5)

This project contains unofficial TypeScript declarations for the Bing Maps v7 AJAX Control. It is meant to bridge the gap between the release of TypeScript and the release of the official Bing Maps declaration files.

The project was started by Roy Donaldson and has been moved here with permission to react to updates easier.

Original Codeplex URL: https://bingmapsts.codeplex.com/
