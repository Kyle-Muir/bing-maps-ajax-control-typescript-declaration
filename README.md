Bing Maps TypeScript Declarations
=================================

### Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Kyle-Muir/bing-maps-ajax-control-typescript-declaration.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Kyle-Muir/bing-maps-ajax-control-typescript-declaration)

This project contains unofficial TypeScript declarations for the Bing Maps v7 AJAX Control. It is meant to bridge the gap between the release of TypeScript and the release of the official Bing Maps declaration files.

The project was started by Roy Donaldson and has been moved here to react to updates easier.

Original Codeplex URL: https://bingmapsts.codeplex.com/

Installation
============

You can download the declaration files directly from Github.

A NuGet package is also available in the public NuGet repository.

Install-Package BingMapsTypeScript

NOTE: The nuget package is currently out of date.
